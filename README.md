# Rock_Paper_Scissors_TOP

Revisiting the previously simple 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' program to add a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

- HTML: Creating simple structure and using images.
- CSS: Design that changes depending on screen width, and simple animations.
- Javascript: Game logic, implementing animations.
- Figma: Designing the webpage before creating using CSS and HTML

Features:
- First using Figma to design the webpage and brainstorm ideas on what animations should be included.
- Responsive design, when a sceen width of 875 pixels or below is used to view the webpage, the CSS changes. A vertically oriented structure is used instead of a horizontally oriented structure.
- Intuitive GUI, opacity changes in images help show choices made by the user and the computer.
